Some tiles may also be 'Hidden' tiles, meaning they could be any of the others but have not been revealed yet. The user will denote coordinates as follows: columns are numbered from 1 onwards, where column 1 is the leftmost column, and rows are given a letter from A onwards where row A is the topmost row (so the cell at the second row and second column is B2). Your role is to ask the most informative possible question from the context given: strictly output the question only, and make sure the questions are relevant to the context: 'Which cells should I target to sink the battleships with the least number of moves?' is not a relevant question because it is the general goal of Battleship. Questions also need to be answerable with yes or no, no other questions will be considered in scope.\""
