## Customization checklist

- Update hero section copy, author links, and call-to-action buttons.
- Replace placeholder teaser, carousel, and dataset visuals with project media.
- Swap the YouTube placeholder `VIDEO_ID` with the real presentation/demo.
- Fill in the abstract, components, dataset, and roadmap sections with final text.
- Provide the released dataset link and BibTeX citation once finalized.
- Remove unused CDN dependencies if unnecessary and add analytics if desired.
